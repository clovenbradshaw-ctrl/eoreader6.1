/**
 * The log as of a named cursor. `cursor` is required and never defaulted
 * to "now" — per eo-constitution CONSTITUTION.md II.17 (the lens fidelity
 * test), a read of this log names its position in it or it is an
 * undeclared clock. "As of this cursor" and "as of whenever this happened
 * to run" are different claims; only the caller who names the cursor gets
 * to make the first one.
 *
 * `cursor` is a COUNT, not a tick index: it means "the first `cursor`
 * events," so `e.tick < cursor` — half-open, like `Array.prototype.slice`.
 * This is deliberate, not the more obvious `e.tick <= cursor`: `log.tick`
 * already means "how many events exist so far" (it's the tick the NEXT
 * append will receive), so `asOf(log, log.tick)` captured once means
 * "everything as of now" SAFELY even if the caller appends more events to
 * the same log afterward — a later event always lands at tick >= the old
 * `log.tick`, never inside the captured slice. An inclusive `<=` cursor
 * does not have this property: a cursor equal to `log.tick` would silently
 * absorb whatever event happens to land at exactly that tick next, turning
 * a "before I appended more" snapshot into a moving target. A caller who
 * genuinely wants the latest state must still say so explicitly —
 * `asOf(log, log.tick)` — never by omission.
