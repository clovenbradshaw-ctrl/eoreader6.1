// eoreader6 · reading — composes multiple named lenses, each declaring its
// own terrain (CUBE.md's nine: Void/Entity/Kind, Field/Link/Network,
// Atmosphere/Lens/Paradigm), into one projection at one shared cursor.
//
// This is the pure-data shape a "read" of a document actually is: not one
// lens's view, but however many terrains a caller has real projections for,
// each still traceable to its own provenance and its own declared/discarded
// event types (eo-constitution CONSTITUTION.md II.17). What this module
// does NOT do — and per Article I.4/III.2 must not do — is render anything.
// No EOT syntax, no surface, no clock, no I/O. Turning a reading into an
// EOT `reader` surface is application work (I.4: the engine owns no
// interface); this stops at the plain object a host can render however it
// needs to.
//
// Only Entity/Link-terrain lenses exist in this engine today
// (referent-identity, modifier-scope). Atmosphere (the reading's own mood
// or register — discourse/index.js's motifs and topic stack are the
// nearest existing organ, not yet wired as a lens) and Paradigm (a reading
// REVISED, not just read — REC territory, a different act than this
// module's) are named in TERRAINS so the shape does not have to be
// redesigned when they arrive. A reading with no lens on a given terrain
// simply omits it, and that omission is visible in `terrains` — never
// silently implied as "there is nothing there."
