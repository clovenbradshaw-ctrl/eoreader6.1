// Two surfaces, so "zetorren" enters the vocabulary through an AFFIRMATIVE
// use after a DIFFERENT surface first (hypergraph.test.mjs's own "loved"
// fixture in the-fold proves the same shape is needed for English: a verb
// that only ever follows a surface inside its own negated clause never
// clears vocabulary discovery, which looks at the token immediately after a
// surface — "ez" sits in that exact slot when Basque negation fronts the

// object shape (`(.+?)(?:\.|,|;|$)`) consumes its own terminating period as
// part of m[0], so `clauseEndAfter(m.index + m[0].length)` searches forward
// from a position already past that period and can land on a LATER
// clause's own terminator instead of "here" — on two short back-to-back
// sentences this walked `previousMatchEnd` past the very match it was
// meant to bound, producing an EMPTY polarity window (`windowStart` ended
// up greater than `subjEnd`) and silently losing a real "ez" this way.
