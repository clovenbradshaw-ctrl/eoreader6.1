// eoreader6 · conformance/reproducibility — a number nobody else can
// reproduce is not a result.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. scripts/RESULTS.md recorded `recalled` at 22/24
// chapter boundaries, p≈0.005, and that figure became load-bearing: spec 11's
// F2 ("the strongest measured channel is in a refuted position") rests on it,
// and Assembly B was built to wire it. It was produced by
// scripts/activation-clearings.mjs against its then-default path,
// `/home/user/eoreader4.2/tests/fixtures/frankenstein.txt` — a file in a
// FROZEN LEGACY REPO that does not exist in this repository at all. Re-run
// against the fixture this repo actually commits, the same script at the same
// spec gives 8/24 causal (p≈0.046) and 5/24 tight (p≈0.209). The relative
// claim survived; the absolute one did not, and nothing in the suite noticed
// for as long as the number sat in the results file.
//
// The constitution already forbids the underlying move — I.2: eoreader4.2 and
// eoreader5 are "frozen reference... Nothing is ported from them; every organ
// is re-earned in eoreader6 or it does not come." A measurement taken against
// a legacy fixture and recorded here as this engine's result is a port wearing
// a number's clothes.
//
// TWO RULES, both mechanical:
//
//   1. No script may DEFAULT to an absolute path. A default is what runs when
//      an agent types `node scripts/x.mjs` with no arguments — it must resolve
//      inside this repository or the script cannot be run at all by anyone but
//      its author. This rule is absolute and has no allowlist.
//
//   2. Absolute path literals ANYWHERE in scripts/ are a counted, named debt.
//      Seventeen files carry them today (War and Peace at
//      /Users/mlacy/Downloads/pg2600.txt, eoreader5 goldens, Basque texts) and
//      the material genuinely is not in this repo, so they cannot simply be
//      repointed. The ratchet: the offender set may SHRINK freely, never grow.
//      A new file appearing here fails the suite.
