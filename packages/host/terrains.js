// by the organ that owns it, at that organ's own standing, and this file's
// whole job is to put those surfaces on the grid the representation standard
// ratified (12-terrains-as-representation-standard.md; the names come from

//   Void        the gap ledger — every typed gap the organs below reported,
//               organ-tagged. Computed-and-empty is a different mark from

//               six silences; here each entry keeps the organ's own typing).

//   Field       the admitted chunks in source order, byte-addressed, plus
//               corpus.js::sessionOutline — deliberately zero-inference.
//   Link        corpus.js::sessionRelations — (subject, verb, object,
//               polarity) triples, each a Figure.
//   Network     graph.js::admitGraph + sessionGraphSnapshot — the belief

//               Byte anchors come from tokenizeWithOffsets + locate() —
//               measured, never re-derived.
//   Lens        NOT SERVED, by construction: a lens is declared by a reader

/**
 * Every terrain surface the session's organs can serve for one admitted
 * source, in one call — except Kind, which is minutes-expensive and lives in
 * sessionKinds() below so a caller can schedule it as a job.
 *
 * The source must already be admitted (admitChunked / ingestFile). A missing
 * source returns a typed gap, never a throw — the caller may be probing.
 *
 * NETWORK AND DOUBLE-ADMISSION: admitGraph advances belief on every call by
 * design (a relation restated is evidence). This assembler keeps the
 * admit-once-per-source discipline admitGraph's own header assigns to its
 * caller, via a per-session record of sources already read into the graph —
 * so calling sessionTerrains twice reports the same belief instead of
 * silently doubling it.
 *
 * `emit(terrain, surface)` (optional): called once per surface AS IT IS
 * COMPUTED, cheapest organs first (Field, Atmosphere, then the cast and
 * what builds on it), so a caller streaming to a reader can reveal each
 * surface the moment it exists instead of waiting on the slowest organ.
 * Measured on the 3.3MB Tolstoy: Field is ready in milliseconds, the cast
 * ~90s later — a single-return caller sees nothing for the whole span.
 * The return value is unchanged and complete either way; Void is emitted
 * last because the ledger accumulates every organ's gaps.

 * not run locally does not exist — and a null that costs a minute must not
 * quietly become a null nobody runs).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: induceKinds fabricates a kind from structureless material
 * in 10.0% of trials against a registered 5% bar (eo-evidence 3b17214,
 * 2026-08-15; 30.0% at the looser settings a real analysis used), and its
 * failure mode is confident-and-wrong (purity 1.000 on anything admitted).
 * So a kind does not ship on the internal gates alone: the SAME pipeline
 * re-runs on copies of THIS population with co-occurrence destroyed — each
 * admitted field's presences redealt across records. Marginal prevalence is
 * preserved (containment: the hypothesis "these fields co-occur" fits inside
 * what the redeal keeps) and co-occurrence is destroyed (licence: it is
 * exactly what a kind is made of, so the statistic moves). Kinds the redealt
 * copies still produce are what fabrication looks like on this population.
 *
 * DRAWS: `opts.nullArmDraws` — declared by the caller, never defaulted, and
 * carried on the result, because the finest rank sayable is 1/draws
 * (FOLD-CONSTITUTION II.4): one redeal buys "the arm's copy produced kinds
 * or it did not", five buy a coarse rate, and the renderer may not phrase
 * the claim finer than the count supports. Each draw redeals with its own
 * seeded stream, deterministically derived from the declared seed.
