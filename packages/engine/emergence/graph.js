// eoreader6 · emergence/graph — THE PRIOR IS A GRAPH, and it evolves.
//
// Every earlier attempt in this repo made the reader's belief a word
// frequency distribution. A reader does not believe "which words are
// likely." A reader believes WHO IS PRESENT AND WHAT THEY DO TO WHOM, and
// Bayesian surprise is how far a passage moves THAT.
//
// The graph is the STRUCTURE tier, which the ladder diagram had as unbuilt:
//   nodes  = Entity   (Existence · Figure)
//   edges  = Link     (Structure · Figure)
//   whole  = Network  (Structure · Pattern)
//
// MODALITY-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION. It consumes (subject, verb, object,
// polarity) triples and never learns where they came from. English SVO comes
// from perceiver/text/relations.js; a video perceiver supplying
// actor-action-target would not change a line here.
//
// Belief movement reuses `bayesianSurprise` unchanged — the "forms" are
// simply edges rather than words, which is the whole reason that function
// takes Maps and totals rather than text.
//
// gamma is the graph's forgetting: a relation not restated fades. That is
// what makes this a reader's evolving belief rather than a cumulative
// transcript, and it is why a motif returning after long enough away can
// move belief again. Declared, never defaulted.
//
// IDENTITY IS WHATEVER IT IS GIVEN. Subjects and objects are keyed by the
// string handed in. Feed it raw surfaces and it builds a surface graph; feed
// it resolved referent ids and it builds a referent graph. The graph does not
// resolve identity and must not — that is coref's job, upstream, and the seam
// is deliberate: it is where an injected eoPriors coref prior wires in.
//
// A5: STRUCTURAL EDGEKEY. Binding-derived links carry polarity but no verb
// — the "co-occur" verb is the machinery's own name, not content. The
// structural key `a|polarity|b` (no verb) runs alongside the verb-inclusive
// key so that both text-derived and binding-derived relations coexist in the
// same Network. The structural key is behind the `structural` flag; when
// reading Link records, both keyings run. `promote` decides using the
// structural key.
