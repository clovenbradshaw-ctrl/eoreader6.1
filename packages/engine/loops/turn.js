// perturbation is refused, not mixed (SEED.md #6, Amendment I: sensitivity is
// a property of the pair). The register is one scalar plus a declared choice,
// never a rollup of the trail — the watcher's regress is refused exactly where
// it was before.
//
// THE FRAME organ (frame/) holds the reading's trail of its own acts — the
// refusal that ended a region and the re-zero that followed, provenance
// "received", the watcher's regress refused by type. It lives apart from the

/**
 * ⑦⑧⑨ DEF/EVA/REC · Atmosphere · Clearing/Tending/Cultivating.
 *
 * An atmosphere boundary is where the accumulated ground stops working and
 * must be rebuilt — not a topic label, not a punctuation rule.
 *
 * A GROUND CAN FAIL TWO WAYS, and both are DEF · Atmosphere · Clearing:
 *
 *   surfeit — the new material EXCEEDS the ground's support. What arrived is
 *     outside what the nothing can place. Detectable from the figure alone:
 *     difference() returns exceeds_witness above. (Censored BELOW is not a
 *     failure — burstiness is a max-over-windows statistic, so an ordinary
 *     real window sits under its support almost always, and SEED.md warns in
 *     as many words that censored-below is regularity and must not be
 *     mistaken for it. Counting it re-zeroed on essentially every step.)
 *
 *   moved — the GROUND ITSELF has shifted under maintenance: rebuilt over the
 *     region as it now stands, it sits further from where it was than merely
 *     reseeding it would put it. That is pattern() — Bateson's difference
 *     that makes a difference, applied to the ambient ground rather than to
 *     a figure.
 *
 * Why the second one had to exist: burstiness is a max over windows, so
 * surfeit responds to whatever lifts the max. That makes it good at LEVEL
 * shifts and unreliable on SPREAD shifts — not blind to them, which was the
 * first draft of this paragraph and was wrong. A big enough variance increase
 * does lift a max. What it misses is a spread change against a ground already
 * wide enough to absorb it, which is the ordinary case once a reader has
 * accumulated anything. Measured on a planted calm → elevated → turbulent
 * series over three seeds: the moved clearing found the spread transition 3/3,
 * surfeit 1/3, and aperture tracked it every time (0.5 → 1.2 → 2.5) while
 * clearing did not. pattern() compares the whole quantile shape of the two
 * grounds, so a spread change displaces it. The two modes read different
 * failures of the same ground.
 *
 * Crucially this invents no new threshold. pattern() carries its own null and
 * `moved` is a comparison against it, not against a number chosen here.
 * `tolerance` stays the one hand-set knob, and both modes count into it,
 * because "the ground failed again" is the same fact either way.
 *
 * What it cost to get right: wired against pattern()'s ORIGINAL null — held
 * at before's extent while `after` grew — this fired on homogeneous noise at
 * near-even spacing and recovered 23/24 Frankenstein chapter boundaries while
 * recovering 21–23/24 from the same series SHUFFLED. See nul/index.js::pattern
 * for the correction and scripts/RESULTS.md for the numbers on both sides
 * of it.
 *
 * Declared, never defaulted: `tolerance` (the resolution of refusal),
 * `window`, `draws`, and now `reseeds` (the resolution of pattern).
 *
 * `clearOn` selects which failure modes count. It is an ABLATION HANDLE, for
 * measuring one mode against the other, not a tuning knob — the shipped
 * reading admits both, because a reader whose ground has moved out from
 * under them has lost it just as surely as one swamped by surfeit.
 *
 * A THIRD MEMBER, `"regularity"`, is not a failure mode and clears nothing.
 * Sustained censored-below is the opposite pole (SEED.md #8, Amendment II)
 * and its remedy is investigation, never re-zero — so opting into it does
 * not add a way to fail; it adds a `findings` channel alongside `events`
 * that the clearing machinery never reads and never triggers from. See
 * `loops/atmosphere`'s `slackRunNull` for the null and conformance for the
 * measured false-alarm rate. Calibrated for statistics whose below-censoring
 * is a genuine, non-chronic event — burstiness's is not (measured: 79-87% of
 * ordinary steps), so this is most informative when `statistic` is
 * `"windowMean"`.
 *
 * A FOURTH MEMBER, `"release"`, is not a failure either. #8 makes re-zero a
 * response to failure; a ground held until it breaks spends its final phase
 * closing, so releasing only on failure means the steady state is always
 * holding something that has already begun to stop working. Opting in
 * concedes the standing ground on a CADENCE instead: once it has been
 * maintained over as much new material again as it was first built over
 * (no new declared number — the extent a ground was built over is already
 * carried as `gEnd - regionStart`). Tagged `clearedBy: "release"`, apart from
 * `"surfeit"`/`"moved"`, because a scheduled concession and a failed one are
 * different facts even though both re-zero. Off by default: existing readers
 * of `regions`/`events` see no new boundaries unless they ask for this.
