// eoreader6 · perceiver/text/pronouns — binding a THIRD-PERSON SINGULAR
// pronoun to a referent BY ACTIVATION, never by nearest name.
//
// surfaces.js's own gap says this plainly: pronoun binding is MODEL tier,
// "not derivable... eoreader5 measured distributional coref failing twice
// (frame-level lift, sentence-level complementary distribution)." Both of
// those attempts asked a WHOLE-DOCUMENT question after the fact — which
// other passage does this one resemble, scored against a vocabulary the
// entire text had already supplied. That is exactly the leak
// emergence/activation.js was built to close for motif recall: a
// whole-document table conditions every score on pages the reader has not
// reached. So this does not invent a second mechanism. It reuses the first
// one (codeOf / recall / encodeFrame, imported whole, never re-derived) and
// asks it a narrower, causal question: given only what has been read so far,
// which NAMED referent's own sentences does THIS sentence's vocabulary most
// resemble, by one recurrent hop?
//
// A referent's own surface, once discoverReferents has admitted it
// (name-variant coreference — engine-tier and already complete, surfaces.js),
// is exactly as good a fact about a sentence as any distinctive recurring
// word: the sentence that carries it is tagged with the referent it named,
// and later, a sentence that shares the FIRST sentence's vocabulary — not its
// name, which is exactly what a pronoun sentence lacks — recalls it by the
// same one-hop completion the rest of this engine already trusts for motifs.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE. Descriptor synonymy ("the creature" ≈ "the
// wretch") is untouched — nothing here reads definite descriptions, and
// surfaces.js's gap stands for that half unchanged. Number-ambiguous
// pronouns ("they"/"them"/"their") are out of scope too: singular-or-plural
// is not decidable from the pronoun alone (priors.js::THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR's
// own header), and guessing one over the other here would be exactly the
// fabrication this codebase refuses everywhere else. A pronoun sharing its
// sentence with a named surface is also left alone — disambiguating which of
// several co-mentioned referents a pronoun in the SAME clause points at is a
// harder, different problem, and this only ever answers the case the
// original complaint names: a scene carried by "he" with no name anywhere
// in it.
//
// WHAT THIS MEASURES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO ASSUME. A pronoun's sentence is
// bound to a referent only when its one-hop recall against the referents
// named so far clears TWO declared bars: an absolute floor (`minActivation`
// — some real echo, not a rounding artefact) and a margin over the runner-up
// (`minMargin` — a decision, not a coin flip between two near-equal
// candidates). Both are declared by the caller, never defaulted here — the
// same standing entity.js's `minArrivals` and kind-void.js's `draws`/`seed`
// already hold: how much activation makes a binding is a property of the
// reading, not a constant this file gets to assume for every caller's
// material. Short of either bar, the pronoun is reported unresolved — a
// typed gap, never a guess dressed as a number.
//
// GENDER IS A HARD FILTER, NEVER A TIEBREAKER, AND IT IS DERIVED, NOT TYPED
// IN. No name list, no honorific table: a referent's gender class is read
// off which gendered pronoun co-occurs with ITS OWN named mentions (a clean
// signal only when exactly one referent is named in that sentence AND the
// pronoun sits in the SAME CLAUSE as that naming — a pronoun beside two
// co-mentioned names is not clean evidence for either, and neither is a
// pronoun beside a name that is only along for the ride in a different
// clause of the same sentence). A referent with no such evidence is never
// excluded by gender; one with clear, contrary evidence always is.
//
// "SAME SENTENCE" WAS TOO WIDE A NET, MEASURED. A wire-service attribution
// clause — "...because none of the organizations contacted by Continental
// Newswire appeared to know who she was" — puts a narrating apparatus as
// the sentence's only literally-named surface while "she" grammatically
// refers to someone this sentence never names at all. Same-sentence
// co-occurrence alone reads that as clean evidence and wrongly tags the
// apparatus female; once tagged, it passes the hard filter below for every
// later she/her pronoun and out-recalls a quietly-named real subject on
// raw activation volume alone (its own name recurs in nearly every
// sentence). Measured on a hand-authored adversarial fixture: 6/6 of a
// quiet subject's own she/her pronouns stolen by a wire-service apparatus
// this way (scripts/adversarial/challenge-23-apparatus-demotion-regression-npr-bug-cl.mjs).
// Clause-locality is the same discipline every other binding decision in
// this file already applies (one-hop recall, not whole-document lift) —
// tightened to the syntactic domain the heuristic's own header always meant:
// a pronoun and the name it echoes belong to the same clause, not merely
// the same sentence. `CLAUSE_OPENER_RE` is a small CLOSED grammatical
// class (English subordinators and relative pronouns), not a sampled
// open-class vocabulary — the same kind of hardcoded closed set this file
// already keeps for THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR itself; closed classes don't grow,
// which is exactly what made relations.js's hand verb list wrong and is
// exactly what makes this list safe.
