// eoreader6 · lens — reads the event log through a declared projection, at
// a cursor it must name.
//
// Per eo-constitution CONSTITUTION.md II.17 (the lens fidelity test): a
// lens is not refused for selecting — every lens selects, that is what
// makes it a reading rather than the log itself (II.6). It is refused for
// two overclaims: presenting a selection as the whole state, and reading
// without a declared cursor. This module is the shape that satisfies both.
//
// A lens is received, not registered — `readLens(log, lensDef, cursor)`
// takes the lens definition as a plain argument, the same way `verdict()`
// takes a ground and `readTriples()` takes a graph: no module-level mutable
// registry, no hidden state the engine "holds" (III.2 — the engine has no
// clock, no I/O, no randomness, no surface, and holds no prior; a stateful
// singleton registry would be a prior this organ holds). Callers that want
// a named catalog of lenses (referent-identity, kind, relation-graph,
// modifier-scope) own that catalog themselves, as a plain object — the same
// seam graph.js documents for triples: "a video perceiver supplying its own
// triples would not change a line here."
//
// `lensDef.reads` is the declared selection: which event_type(s) this lens
// actually consumes. `readLens` uses it two ways — to filter what reaches
// `project()`, and to report `discardedTypes`, the event types that existed
// in the same slice of the log but this lens did not read. Completeness is
// never implied by omission: a caller holding only `view` cannot tell what
// was left out, but a caller holding the full result always can.
//
// `provenance` traces the view back to the exact events it was built from
// (event_id, tick, event_type) — the same discipline provenance/index.js
// already applies to passage citations, applied here to projections.
//
// Pure: no clock, no randomness, no I/O.
